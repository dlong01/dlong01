Hi, I'm Daniel Long. I'm currently studying Computer Science MSc at The University of Nottingham. 

My gitHub showcases a number of projects I have previously worked on and am currently working on. These mainly include game development projects, but in future I am looking to start working on some robotics projects as well as more mixed reality work.

I am currently looking to work in a software engineering/development role in any number of sectors. Thanks for taking the time to view my profile.
